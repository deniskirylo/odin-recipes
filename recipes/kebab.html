    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make your own version of this takeaway favorite, complete with chilli and garlic sauces. Serve your homemade doner kebab with pitta bread and shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1 small onion, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>sunflower oil for oiling</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><i>To serve</i></h4>
    <p>pitta breads, shredded red or white cabbage, sliced onion, chopped tomatoes, pickled chillies, chilli sauce 
       (see recipe below), garlic sauce (see recipe below), tahini</p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with 
            a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. 
            You can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.</li>
        <li>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly 
            the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.</li>
        <li>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a 
            digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, 
            then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.</li>
        <li>Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a 
            roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, 
            including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
